#SiliconLabs Thunderboard Web Client
---

REMINDER:
Please not that this package contains old, deprecated libraries and codes!
Please comment here, if you can make this work using Firebase.

##Introduction
The web client is built with various web tools including:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for overall view architecture
	- [Alt.js](http://alt.js.org/) for the [flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) implementation with React
	- [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) for routing within the app
	- [React D3 Components](https://github.com/codesuki/react-d3-components) for using D3 charts with React
- [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) For data-driven charts
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as the real-time back-end service
- [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) for CSS pre-processing
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for building and minifying code
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager

---

##Getting Started
1. After downloading the source, you will need to get all of the required packages to run the local server. 
	- Run `npm install` (For more information on npm, see [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/))
2. After install completes, you can run `gulp watch` to start the live-reload server. If a browser did not open, you can go to `localhost:8080` to view the base page. 
3. To build the minified version of the code, use `gulp build`
4. When streaming data to Firebase from the device, you will be given a URL with the scheme of `/#/ (device id) / (session id) / (demo type)`
	- All valid URLs can be found in `src/js/main.js`
	
##Firebase Setup
1. Setup a [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) account and database.
2. Set that Firebase url on `line 16` of `src/js/main.js`
	- `window.firebaseURL = 'https://___________.firebaseio.com/bluegecko/';`
3. Set the firebase project name on `line 2` of `firebase.json`. It should be something like `glowing-inferno-55555`
4. Install the [Firebase command line tools](https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/command-line-tool.html) which will allow you to deploy your changes to Firebase.
